    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups flour </li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar (white)</li>
        <li>1/2 onion (medium, finely chopped)</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons milk </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon parsley flakes (or finely chopped fresh parsley)</li>
        <li>avocado oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together sugar, salt (about 1/3 teaspoon) and flour. Add olive oil. Add water to the flour mixture (a small amount at a time) mixing it and kneading dough until it's even, soft and doesn't stick to your hands. Add a little more flour if the dough is sticky, or water if it's stiff. Place the dough aside and prepare the filling.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together ground beef, finely chopped onion and parsley. Season the mixture with salt and pepper and stir in milk.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough until it is about 1/10-1/8 inch (2.5-3mm) thick. Cut circles using a small tea plate. Gather the rest of the dough into a ball and roll again. Repeat until you used all the dough. </li>
        <li>Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling on one side of the circle, leaving 1/2 inch (about 1cm) space at the edges.</li>
        <li>Fold the other half of the circle over and pinch the edges firmly together using your fingers.</li>
        <li>Make sure there is no air inside chebureki and the edges are closed tightly.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the oil for deep frying (it should cover about 1/2 of a cheburek), reduce heat to medium and place 3 or 4 chebureki into oil (depending on the size of your skillet). Fry chebureki on both sides until nicely and evenly brown (about 5 minutes per each side).</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels, let rest for a few minutes. Serve while still hot.</li>
    </ol>
